  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I am a climate scientist at the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD). My expertise includes climate dynamics, large-scale atmospheric teleconnections and climate
impacts on health. In my research, I have focused on extreme climate events (heatwaves, droughts), tropical and
subtropical precipitation changes, large-scale atmospheric teleconnections as well as impacts of heat on mortality and
occupational health. </p>
